    "longdescription": "This plugin allows you to use any version of Binary Ninja headlessly and remotely to script and control Binja remotely without the need of an entreprise license. This makes it convenient for creating scripts, or live reversing using Jupyter for instance. It works internally by simply creating an RPyc service within the Python environment, and expose it on a TCP socket. Note that this plugin is Binary Ninja specific: an equivalent for IDA was created in the repository [IDA-Headless](https://github.com/hugsy/ida-headless).",
